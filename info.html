        <h2>General information</h2>
        <p>
          The first letter of a note name must be always a capital (uppercase
          letter). A lowercase letter indicating a minor chord is not supported
          and rarely used in practice (except for Roman). When the Output format
          is set to Roman, the note names for minor and diminished chords will
          be in lowercase.

        <h2>Input format</h2>
        <p>
          It is important to choose the correct Input format. For example, when
          there are chords with the text lines, the Input format need to be set
          to "[C] Inline".
        </p>
        <h2>Strict</h2>
        <p>
          Normally it is best to have Strict enabled to prevent normal text from
          being changed. If there are unusual chords in the text, you can
          disable Strict and correct some text later if needed.
        </p>
        <h2>Brackets</h2>
        <p>
          The Brackets settings are used for the inline formats. The first
          bracket setting is for the input and the second bracket setting is for
          the output (result).
        </p>
        <h2>Use sharps (#)</h2>
        <p>
          Enable this option if you prefer to see sharps (#) instead of flats
          (b) on the result. Enable Special chars if you want real music
          symbols, but keep in mind that if you want to use the result in other
          software these characters might not be supported.
        </p>
        <h2>Use Ti</h2>
        <p>
          If the Output format is set to "Do Re Mi" and you want Ti instead of
          Si on the result, enable Use Ti. If the Input format is set to "Do Re
          Mi", both Ti and Si are recognized independently of the Use Ti
          setting.
        </p>
        <h2>Special chars</h2>
        <p>
          Enable Special chars if you prefer real music symbols for sharps (#),
          flats (b) etc., but keep in mind that if you want to use the result in
          other software these characters might not be supported.
        </p>
        <h2>Space between chords</h2>
        <p>
          When this option is enabled, there will be always at least one space
          character between two chords. When the Output format is set to Roman
          there will be always at least one space character between two chords
          independent of the "Space between chords" setting, because when there
          is no space between the I chord and the V chord, it is in fact the IV
          chord.
        </p>
        <h2>Compact</h2>
        <p>
          Enable this option if you want compact chord symbols. If in the
          original text long chord names are used, they will be converted to
          short chord names. For example minor will be converted to m and maj7
          will be converted to M7 or even just a delta symbol when Special chars
          is enabled.
        </p>
        <h2>Uppercase notes</h2>
        <p>
          When this option is enabled, the letters of the note names will be in
          capitals. This option has only influence on the result when the Output
          format is set to "Do Re Mi" or Greek. For example, Solm7 will be
          converted to SOLm7.
        </p>
        <h2>Original key</h2>
        <p>
          The "Original key" setting is only used for the Output format Roman.
          The key of a song is mostly the last chord.
        </p>
        <h2>Semitones</h2>
        <p>
          With this setting you adjust the number of semitones that the chords
          will be transposed up or down. When the number is negative, the chords
          will be transposed down. When you only want to convert to another
          format, Semitones must be set to 0. When the Output format is set to
          Roman, the Semitones setting is ignored.
        </p>
