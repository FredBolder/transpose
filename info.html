        <h2>General information</h2>
        <p>
          If there is normal text in the chord line and the Input format is not
          "[C] Inline", the line will be ignored. An exception is the "|"
          character, which will not be visible in the result. The first letter
          of a note name must be a capital (uppercase letter), except when
          Lowercase=minor is enabled or when the Input format is set to Roman.
          When the Output format is set to Roman, the note names for minor and
          diminished chords will be in lowercase.<br />
          The text after a slash is interpreted as a bass note, so don't use
          chord names like D6/9. You can use D69 instead. Inversions that are
          sometimes used in Roman numerals are not supported.

        </p>
        <h2>Input format</h2>
        <p>
          It is important to choose the correct Input format. For example, when
          there are chords with the text lines, the Input format need to be set
          to "[C] Inline".
        </p>
        <h2>Strict</h2>
        <p>
          Normally it is best to have Strict enabled to prevent normal text from
          being changed. If there are unusual chords in the text, you can
          disable Strict and correct some text later if needed.
        </p>
        <h2>Lowercase=minor</h2>
        <p>
          When this option is enabled, the lowercase notes in the input will be
          capitalized and the chord type will be changed to minor.
        </p>
        <h2>Brackets</h2>
        <p>
          The Brackets settings are used for the inline formats. The first
          bracket setting is for the input and the second bracket setting is for
          the output (result).
        </p>
        <h2>Use sharps (#)</h2>
        <p>
          Enable this option if you prefer to see sharps (#) instead of flats
          (b) on the result. This option has only influence on the note names,
          so D7#5 will not change. Enable Special chars if you want real music
          symbols, but keep in mind that if you want to use the result in other
          software these characters might not be supported. When the Output
          format is set to German, there are no sharp or flat symbols in the
          note name, but if Use sharps is enabled, you will see for example Cis
          instead of Des.
        </p>
        <h2>Use Ti</h2>
        <p>
          If the Output format is set to "Do Re Mi" and you want Ti instead of
          Si on the result, enable Use Ti. If the Input format is set to "Do Re
          Mi", both Ti and Si are recognized independently of the Use Ti
          setting.
        </p>
        <h2>Special chars</h2>
        <p>
          Enable Special chars if you prefer real music symbols for sharps (#),
          flats (b) etc., but keep in mind that if you want to use the result in
          other software these characters might not be supported.
        </p>
        <h2>Space between chords</h2>
        <p>
          When this option is enabled, there will be always at least one space
          character between two chords. When the Output format is set to Roman
          there will be always at least one space character between two chords
          independent of the "Space between chords" setting, because when there
          is no space between the I chord and the V chord, it is in fact the IV
          chord.
        </p>
        <h2>Compact</h2>
        <p>
          Enable this option if you want compact chord symbols. If in the
          original text long chord names are used, they will be converted to
          short chord names. For example minor will be converted to m and maj7
          will be converted to M7 or even just a delta symbol when Special chars
          is enabled.
        </p>
        <h2>Uppercase notes</h2>
        <p>
          When this option is enabled, the letters of the note names will be in
          capitals. This option has only influence on the result when the Output
          format is set to "Do Re Mi" or Greek. For example, Solm7 will be
          converted to SOLm7.
        </p>
        <h2>Key</h2>
        <p>
          The "Key" setting is only used for Roman numerals. The key of a song
          is mostly the last chord.
        </p>
        <h2>Semitones</h2>
        <p>
          With this setting you adjust the number of semitones that the chords
          will be transposed up or down. When the number is negative, the chords
          will be transposed down. When you only want to convert to another
          format, Semitones must be set to 0. When the Output format is set to
          Roman, the Semitones setting is ignored.
        </p>
        <h2>Output format</h2>
        <p>With this setting you can adjust the format of the result.</p>
        <h2>Transpose / Convert</h2>
        <p>Press this button to generate a result in the second text area.</p>
        <h2>Down</h2>
        <p>
          Press the Down button to decrease (if possible) the Semitones setting
          and to generate a result.
        </p>
        <h2>Up</h2>
        <p>
          Press the Up button to increase (if possible) the Semitones setting
          and to generate a result.
        </p>
        <h2>Copy</h2>
        <p>
          Press the Copy button to copy the complete result to the clipboard.
