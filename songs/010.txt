{title: Are you lonesome tonight?}

Dm  G7  C  G7

        C          Em            Am
Are you lonesome tonight, do you miss me tonight?
        C        C7       F
Are you sorry we drifted apart?
          G                 G7
Does your memory stray to a brighter summer day
       G7                             C
When I kissed you and called you sweetheart?
       C7                         F
Do the chairs in your parlor seem empty and bare?
       D                         Dm         G
Do you gaze at your doorstep and picture me there?
        C                 Em            D
Is your heart filled with pain, shall I come back again?
        Dm            G7         C
Tell me dear, are you lonesome tonight?
