{comment: Verse 1:}
 Am     C         G     Em
Alas my love, you do me wrong,
   Am             E
to cast me off discourteously.
    Am     C         G        Em
For I have loved you well and long,
  Am       E7      Am
delighting in your company.

C                G      Em
Greensleeves was all my joy,
Am               E
Greensleeves was my delight,
C                   G        Em
Greensleeves was my heart of gold,
    Am         E7   Am
and who but my lady Greensleeves.

{comment: Verse 2:}
  Am        C     G       Em
I have been ready at your hand
   Am             E
to grant whatever you would crave.
  Am        C       G        Em
I have both wagered life and land,
     Am       E7        Am
your love and good-will for to have.

      Am     C       G      Em
Well, I will pray to God on high,
     Am              E
that thou my constancy mayst see,
    Am       C      G      Em
and that yet once before I die,
     Am        E7      Am
thou wilt vouchsafe to love me.
